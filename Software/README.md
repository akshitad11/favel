- [**controller**](Software/controller): The controller of the application. Calling other module or organizing the work from input to output.
- [**datastructures**](Software/datastructures): The data structure defining classes like Assertion as a python object and Definition of custom class exceptions
    - [**exceptions**](Software/datastructures/exceptions): Custom module exceptions
- [**FactValidationService**](Software/FactValidationService): Module containing fact validation services responsible of validating the insertions he gets as input. It sends fact to the containers, gets the response, and caches if necessary.

- [**InputService**](Software/InputService): The input service, reads the input dataset and transform it into a format that the software can easily use.
- [**FAVEL ML Service**](Software/MLService): The Machine learning service. Responsible of receiving a dataset of fact validation with scores from different approaches, train a given machine learning model and test a given assertion to predict it's veracity using the trained model
    - [**models**](Software/MLService/models)
- [**FAVEL Output Service**](Software/OutputService): Write the result in an evaluation format like Gerbil or in the evaluation folder.
- [**test**](Software/test): All the test written for the software
